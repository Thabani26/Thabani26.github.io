  <h1>Why Every Business Needs a Website</h1>
  <p>In today’s fast-paced digital world, having a website is no longer optional—it’s a necessity. A website acts as your online storefront, available to customers 24/7. It builds credibility, showcases your products or services, and allows you to reach a wider audience beyond your local area.</p>
  <p>Potential customers often search online before making a purchase decision. Without a website, your business risks being invisible to these prospects. A professional website also gives you control over your brand image, unlike social media pages that you don’t own.</p>
  <p>Furthermore, a website opens up opportunities for online marketing, customer engagement, and even e-commerce sales. Whether you’re a small local shop or a growing brand, your online presence is a powerful tool to connect with customers and grow your business.</p>
